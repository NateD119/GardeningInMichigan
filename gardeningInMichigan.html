In Southeast Michigan, our seasons are always changing. This creates many different opportunities to have different flowers blooming and nearly all times of the year. From the first Spring Crocus to the last remaining ornamental grasses to be cut in the fall, Michigan will never disapoint when it comes to gardens. This site will show some ideas to help pick the perfect plants for your garden.
</p>
<p>
Before you run off to a nursery or your local <a href="https://nfmd.org/">farmers market</a>, take a walk around your yard and take some notes. Just a few basic notes to make....
</p>
<ul>
	<li>How much sun does this spot get?</li>
    <li>When it rains, how quickly does the garden dry? </li>
    <li>When there is a windstorm, is the area protected from the wind? </li>
</ul>
<p>When researching plants, these are just a few details that go into planting the perfect garden. Each plant will come with a tag that gives recommended amounts of sun and what kind of drainage the plant prefers. There are other factors such as soil types, but before we get into that, the above notes will be more than enought to get your garden started. 
</p>
<p>
	One thing before we get started, the amount of sun required for a plant is based on the Summer. A sunny bed in April may be part-shade by early May, and even full shade by mid-May. Once you get to know the details of your yard, you can use the other pages on this site to help you plan which plants would work best with your garden. 
</p>
<p>You may have noticed that different areas of your yard are completely different growing conditions from one another. What a great opportunity to plant different kinds of gardens that will bring color and contrast to your yard. <a href="butterflyGarden.html"> Butterfly gardens</a> have become increasingly popular over the years. If you struggle with Deer and other critters using your garden as a buffet, check out some <a href="deerResistant.html">deer resistant</a> plants.
